Hello,

My name is Oisín Byrne and this is my Web Development Portfolio: 

**https://studiousvanilla.github.io/portfolio/**

In May 2020, I lost my job due to the Covid19 pandemic. I had already dipped my toe into the world of web development, completing a certificate in Computer Programming from DCU earlier that year, and so I decieded to really invest my time in learning as much as I could about the world of programming.

After some research, I discovered The Odin Project: A self-taught, full-stack Javascript course.
(https://www.theodinproject.com/)

Now, I'm nearing the end of the course and I'm eager to apply what I've learnt, and learn a lot more.

I'm looking for a position as a Junior Developer and so I built this site as a central repositroy of information about me.

This portfolio showcases all my projects and has links to Github account,  my contact information and my CV.

Each project in my portfolio has its own github repository and a link to where the project has been deployed.

I hope you enjoy the portfolio and let me know if you've any questions.

Thanks, and all the best,

Oisín
